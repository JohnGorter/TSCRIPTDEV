Lab 3 - Structuring code

If the exercise was not successful in the last lab, you can copy and paste the pervious solution from the *labs_solution* folder.

Exercise 1 - Split the code into Multiple files.

- Split `Customer` into it's own file.
- Split `BankAccount` into it's own file.

Exercise 2 - Activate compiler options.

- Activate all code quality compiler options.
- Define in `printBalance` function inside the `BankAccount.ts`.
- Make a initialisation function that prints the balance for every customer.
