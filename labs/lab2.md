Lab 2 - Classes and interfaces

If the exercise was not successful in the last lab, you can copy and paste the pervious solution from the *labs_solution* folder.

In this Lab you are going to refactor and improve the code base to make it *Object Oriented*. 
We will be doing this by using `Classes` and `Interfaces`.

Exercise 1 - Creating a bankAccount `class`

- Inside the `Main.ts` create an class called `BankAccount`.
    - Give it the attributes `accountNumber` and `balance`.
    - private function to generate the accountNumber.

Exercise 2 - Creating a customer interface.

- Inside the `Main.ts` create an interface called `Customer`.
    - Customer definition:
        - firstname, lastname, preposition, bankAccount.

Exercise 3 - Implement the `Customer` interface.

- Inside the `Main.ts` create a `CustomerImpl` class.
    - Implement the `Customer` interface
