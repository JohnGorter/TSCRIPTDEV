## Recap

* Syntax follows ECMAscript specification, although it has some small differences
* Functionality compares to C# and Java
    * `abstract`, `private`, `get`, `set`, `readonly`
* A TypeScript class declares both the Constructor function as well as the type which describes the *shape* of the instances of the class.
