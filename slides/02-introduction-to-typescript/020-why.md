## Why TypeScript?

JavaScript has issues

* Broken `this` pointer
* `"use strict";` - strict mode
* Missing important features
    * Splitting scopes, Interfaces, Classes
    * Some of which might come in the future

---

## Why?

JavaScript is too dynamic for the most usecases

* Large code bases make people scared!
    * Refactoring is often find-replace, very brittle
    * IDE support is limited

## TypeScript as a solution

TypeScript introduces optional static typing to JavaScript

* Refactoring becomes easier
* Great IDE support
* At worst, it provides good static code analysis
