## Why?

1. JavaScript has issues
    * Broken `this` pointer
    * `"use strict";` - strict mode
    * Missing important features
        * Splitting scopes, interfaces, classes
        * Some of which might come in the future

---

## Why?

2. JavaScript is too dynamic for the most usecases
    * Large code bases make people scared!
        * Refactoring is often find-replace, very brittle
        * IDE support is limited

<!-- .element start="2" -->

## TypeScript as a solution

TypeScript introduces optional static typing to JavaScript

* Refactoring becomes easier
* Good IDE support
* At worst, it provides good static code analysis
